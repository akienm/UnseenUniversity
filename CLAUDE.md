# UnseenUniversity — Claude Code bootstrap

This is the portable agent runtime substrate. It is **not** TheIgors.

## What to read first

```bash
# Spec decisions (in TheIgors palace, not this repo):
# memory_get(path="unseenuniversity/decisions/D-agent-datacenter-spec-2026-04-27")
# memory_get(path="unseenuniversity/decisions/D-adc-phase-0-2026-04-27")  ... phase-5
```

## Structural rules

- **device.py** and **shim.py** are the design center. Every component inherits from
  `BaseDevice` / `BaseShim`. OOP-first — no standalone functions doing device work.
  *Why: a single well-known entry point per device makes lifecycle management (start/stop/restart/self-test)
  uniform; the framework can iterate all devices without knowing their internals.*
- **bus/** owns comms:// routing. Nothing outside bus/ speaks to IMAP directly.
  *Why: transport decoupling — swapping IMAP for another transport requires touching only bus/, not every device.*
- **skeleton/** owns the MCP aggregator and flat-file registry. No Postgres dependency.
  *Why: skeleton must boot before the DB is up; a Postgres dependency in skeleton would make cold-start impossible.*
- **devices/** contains one subdirectory per device; each is independently deployable.
  *Why: blast radius containment — a broken device import can't crash the whole rack on import.*
- **datacenter_logs/<device>/<subsystem>/** is the log hierarchy. Never write to a flat
  root log file.
  *Why: flat root logs from multiple devices are ungreppable without knowing which device wrote what; hierarchy makes per-device debugging self-contained.*
- **Log every state change and every interface crossing.** State changes: ticket status
  transitions, device lifecycle events (start/stop/restart/halt), routing decisions,
  auth/trust events. Interface crossings: channel post/read, DB write/read, subprocess
  spawn, MCP tool dispatch, device/shim boundary method calls. Log at INFO for crossings,
  DEBUG for high-frequency state changes (e.g. Hebbian edge weight updates).
  *Why: without a log at the crossing point, a bug at a device boundary is invisible — you
  can't tell whether the problem is in the sender or the receiver, or whether the message
  crossed at all. Enforced by audit check AR-009.*

## Bus + shim model — what the rack gives for free

A CC session misdiagnosing "agent-to-agent RPC" as a missing capability is a known false pattern. The rack already has everything needed.

**IDLE push — agents don't poll.** `IMAPServer.idle_wait(mailbox)` is the receive primitive. A device's bus-facing component (`AnnounceListener`, `HealthAggregator`, etc.) runs an `idle_wait` loop in a background thread started by `shim.start()`. When a message arrives the loop wakes, calls `fetch_unseen()`, and dispatches. `BaseShim` itself has no `idle_wait` — the lifecycle is `start/stop/restart/self_test/rollback`. The IDLE loop lives in the component the shim launches, not in the shim class.

**Request/response is built in.** Every envelope carries `from_device` (sender) and `to_device` (destination). To do request/response: append to target, let it append its reply to `env.from_device`, and your `idle_wait` delivers it. No RPC library needed. The announce → manifest flow (`comms://announce` → reply to caller's mailbox) is the canonical live example. When the reply should go to a *different* address than `from_device`, include `reply_to` in the payload by convention (payload field, not a rigid envelope field).

**Canonical reference:** `unseen_university/announce/listener.py` `AnnounceListener.run_forever()` — the complete IDLE loop pattern in ~15 lines.

## Workflow — picking what to work on

**Use `/query-ticket` to ask what's next.** It is the single canonical entry
point for "what should I work on?" — it abstracts cc_queue.py today and will
transparently switch to the ADC queue rack device when that ships.

- `/query-ticket` — read-only, surfaces next ticket, never claims
- `/sprint` (no args) → calls `/query-ticket` logic internally
- Never call `cc_queue.py next` or `cc_queue.py list` directly to pick work

Autonomous CC sprinting is handled by **Granny**: when she routes a ticket to
`worker=cc`, she spawns `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions /sprint-ticket T-xxx`
directly. The old `worker_daemon.sh` is retired — Granny is the dispatcher.

## Environment variables

Two canonical env vars. Everything else derives from them.

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `UU_ROOT` | auto-detected via `unseen_university._uu_root.uu_root()` | Repo root. Set explicitly only when auto-detection fails. |
| `IGOR_HOME` | `~/.unseen_university` | Runtime data dir (logs, slate, flags). Override for non-default installs. |

`CC_WORKFLOW_TOOLS` is a **derived alias** — `${UU_ROOT}/devlab/claudecode`. Keep it in `.bashrc` for one deprecation cycle; new code uses `uu_root()` directly.

Auto-detection order for `UU_ROOT`: (1) env var, (2) `unseen_university.__file__` parent chain, (3) `pip show unseen-university` Location, (4) `cwd`.

## Hard rules

- **⛔ NO SQLITE. EVER. POSTGRES OR FLAT-FILE ONLY.** See banner at top of this file.
  *Why: SQLite under concurrent write load (multiple devices) produces lock contention and silent data loss; Postgres handles that correctly. If architecture docs say SQLite, those docs are wrong — correct them.*
- No TheIgors imports. UnseenUniversity must be portable without TheIgors present.
  *Why: UU is the substrate that TheIgors runs on top of, not vice versa; a circular dependency makes UU non-deployable on any other host.*
- No live keys or passwords in source. `.env` is gitignored.
  *Why: keys in source appear in git history permanently even after removal — the only safe state is never committed.*
- `pip install -e .` must succeed at all times (even with empty stubs).
  *Why: broken install blocks every other developer and CI from even importing the package; it's the first gate of the build contract.*
